### Import libraries and other model file

## For loop
# inside for loop
# scale data try using different types of scalers 
# make training and test sets that are randomized each time (keep size and y = stratify)
# call all three functions make predictions using the fit with each new training and test data
# display accuracies and confusion matrix and other things needed

# after display 1 of the samples in gui maybe idk 
# Note the Neural network takes a while to run like 3-4 mins btw
